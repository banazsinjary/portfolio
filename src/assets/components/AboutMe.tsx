            Hey there! I'm Banaz, a recent graduate with a Bachelors of Science
            in Computer Science from San Francisco State University. ðŸŽ“ During
            my two-year-long front-end development internship, I delved into the
            wonderful world of TypeScript and Litelement frameworks, mastering
            the art of crafting dynamic and user-friendly web experiences. ðŸ’»
            APIs and maintaining legacy code? No problemo! 
          </p>

                Beyond coding, I find solace in exploring the great outdoors and conquering hiking trails.
                Nature fuels my creativity and inspires my problem-solving skills.
                ðŸŒ² When I'm not immersed in the tech world, you'll find me
                perfecting my yoga poses, finding my zen on the mat. ðŸ§˜ And did I
                mention I'm a coffee aficionado? As a skilled barista, I create
                delicious caffeinated wonders to kickstart the day. â˜•

                With an innate curiosity and a passion for continuous learning, I thrive in
                fast-paced environments that fuel my hunger for growth. I embrace
                challenges with open arms, always seeking opportunities to expand my
                knowledge and skill set. ðŸš€

                Join me on this exciting journey as we explore the intersections of technology, nature, and
                self-expression. Let's create something incredible together!
